     	<p class="Center">Up The Irons is the ultimate Iron Maiden Tribute band.
        Unlike your regular coverband, we put on a spectacular, high-energy show complete with stage props, effects and on stage "Eddie" monsters that simulate a perfect Iron Maiden show. Combine that with note for note accuracy and musicianship and the "win-win" combination of 5 wild Iron Maiden freaks playing the original "Iron Maiden" hits and you have an unbeatable formula that guarantees a night to remember.

     	<h1 class="Center">Within Temptation</h1>
     	<img src="images/within_temptation.jpg" height="300" width="400" class="centerimage">
     	<p>Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the "gothic" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal. Enter even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that "we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band". 

        After the release of their debut album Enter in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single "Ice Queen" from their second album Mother Earth, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Their next albums The Silent Force (2004) and The Heart of Everything (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts. In 2008, they released a live DVD and CD, Black Symphony, recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by An Acoustic Night at the Theatre, another live album.
